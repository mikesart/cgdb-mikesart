 * This unit is responsible for parsing annotations from the output of gdb.
 * It can distinguish between output that is an annotation and output that 
 * is not an annotation. It sends all output that is not an annotation to 
 * the data package and all output that is an annotation to the annotation 
 * package. It does not interpret the data in any way.
 * All output from gdb must be filtered through this function.
